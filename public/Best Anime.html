<h1>The Best Anime According to Anchal</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Anime of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>It has the coolest graphics I have ever seen and storyline was awesome but it is still ongoing and thats the saddest part.</p>
<h3>Haikyuu!</h3>
<p>Who doesnot like it? It was very nice to see their passion for their dreams.</p>
<h3>Hunter X Hunter</h3>
<p>Very competative and creative anime.</p>
